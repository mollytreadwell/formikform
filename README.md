# Introduction To Formik

This is a simple exercise in the use of Formik, a "lightweight library" that aids in React programming. Formik helps the developer generate clean, organized forms that can be validated quickly and with ease.

## It's All In The Code

In this example, I created a simple form where the user writes in their email address, password and clicks a submit button to theoretically login to a site. Formik's validation efforts come into effect if either email address or password are not provided by the user, in which case an error message will be automated to the screen.
